# Trevor Learns to Code

Hello! And welcome to my journey into tech. 

My name is Trevor Wallis and I am currently a poor-man's database manager for the Clever Real Estate content team. 

What is a "poor-man's database manager," you ask? 

Well, I manage about 10M cells of data in Google Sheets. Our content team uses inline data injection to pull information directly from Google Sheets into our website. I organize and automate all of our spreadsheets so our content stays as up-to-date as possible. 

I started learning JavaScript so I could better manage our spreadsheets (Google's native functions sometimes don't do what I need, after all!) and that spurred an interest in learning more. 

Now, I've decided to learn and apply JS outside of Google App Script. 

## About this project

My goal is to learn out loud. 

This will be a collection of simple JS apps that I use to improve my skills. You won't find anything new, novel, or extraordinary here. 

Instead, you'll find the wondering path of guy who's stumbling his way into tech. 

All these projects are certainly things you've seen before (since I found them by googling "beginner javascript projects"), but hopefully they'll give me the experience I need to feel confident in my abilities and begin building my own ideas.
