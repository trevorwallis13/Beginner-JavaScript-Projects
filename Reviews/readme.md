# Simple Reviews Page

Project 3 from John Smilga's Vanilla JavaScript Projects

https://www.vanillajavascriptprojects.com/

This simple reviews app cycles through review data from a provided array. 

Next and previous buttons go forward/backward through the list of reviewers. 

Random button selects a random reviewer from the list without showing the same person twice in a row. 

## Ideas for next phase

Create a second page (linked in <nav>) to intake reviews.

## Long term ideas

Integrate a database to store/recall user reviews.
